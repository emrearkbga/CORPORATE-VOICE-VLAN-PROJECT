I am sharing my detailed network project with you, which includes essential components for today's corporate networks such as Subnetting, Switching, Routing, Vlan Trunking, Voice Vlan, Telephony Service, and DHCP. You can explore, practice, and enhance it on GitHub.

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First): We used the OSPF protocol for Layer 3 dynamic routing within the network, effectively routing traffic and making our network easily scalable as it grows.

VLAN Trunking: We utilized VLANs to isolate and manage different departments and functions, enhancing security and data isolation.

Voice VLAN: By creating a dedicated VLAN for voice traffic, we improved the quality of VoIP phones and streamlined communication.

Telephony Service: We integrated telecommunications services effectively, bringing VoIP phone systems into our network.

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): Using DHCP servers, we automated the assignment of IP addresses and other network settings to devices, streamlining our workflow.
